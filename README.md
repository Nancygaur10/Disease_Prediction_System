# Disease Prediction System

A **Machine Learning–based web application** built with **Django** that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
The application uses a trained **GradientBoosting Classifier** to analyze symptoms and provide prediction results along with a saved medical history.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Disease Prediction System** allows users to select or enter symptoms, submit them, and instantly get a predicted disease based on trained machine-learning logic.
The system also maintains a **medical history** table, which stores past user inputs and prediction results.

## 🚀 Features

✅ 1. About Section

A clean informational section explaining the purpose of the system.

✅ 2. Disease Prediction Page

-  User fills a form containing symptoms

-  Model predicts the disease using GradientBoosting Classifier

-  Displays prediction result clearly

✅ 3. Medical History Section

-  Stores and displays previous predictions

-  Pagination / table display

-  Shows symptom values and prediction results
